//Given an array A[ ] of positive integers of size N, where each value represents the number of chocolates in a packet. Each packet can have a variable number of chocolates. 
//There are M students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets among M students such that :
//1. Each student gets exactly one packet.
//2. The difference between maximum number of chocolates given to a student and minimum number of chocolates given to a student is minimum.
