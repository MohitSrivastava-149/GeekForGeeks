//Given an array arr[ ] of size N having elements, 
//the task is to find the next greater element for each element of the array in order of their appearance in the array.
//Next greater element of an element in the array is the nearest element on the right which is greater than the current element.
//If there does not exist next greater of current element, then next greater element for current element is -1. 
//For example, next greater of the last element is always -1.
