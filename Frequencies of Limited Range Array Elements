//Given an array arr[] of N positive integers which can contain integers from 1 to P where elements can be repeated or can be absent from the array. 
//Your task is to count the frequency of all numbers from 1 to N. Make in-place changes in arr[], such that arr[i] = frequency(i). Assume 1-based indexing.
//Note: The elements greater than N in the array can be ignored for counting and do modify the array in-place. 


class Solution{
    public static void frequencyCount(int arr[], int N, int P)
    {
        P++;
        for(int i=0; i<N; i++){
            int index = arr[i]%P -1;
            if(index >= 0 && index < N){
                arr[index] += P;
            }
        }
        for(int i=0; i<N; i++){
            arr[i] /= P;
